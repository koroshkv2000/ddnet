Welcome to DDNet
== 

DDraceNetwork is a cooperative online game where the goal is for you and your group of tees to reach the finish line of the map. As a newcomer you should start on Novice servers, which host the easiest maps. Consider the ping to choose a server close to you.
== 

The maps contain freeze, which temporarily make a tee unable to move. You have to work together to get through these parts.
== 

The mouse wheel changes weapons. Hammer (left mouse) can be used to hit other tees and wake them up from being frozen.
== 

Hook (right mouse) can be used to swing through the map and to hook other tees to you.
== 

Most importantly communication is key: There is no tutorial so you'll have to chat (t key) with other players to learn the basics and tricks of the game.
== 

Use k key to kill (restart), q to pause and watch other players. See settings for other key binds.
== 

It's recommended that you check the settings to adjust them to your liking before joining a server.
== 

Please enter your nickname below.
==

== 

Your nickname '%s' is already used (%d points). Do you still want to use it?
==

== 

There's an unsaved map in the editor, you might want to save it before you quit the game.
== 

Quit anyway?
